# gpt-graph

gpt-graph is a text-to-graph application that uses GPT-3 to generate a graph of entities and their relationships. GPT-3 is a language model developed by OpenAI that can perform a variety of natural language tasks, including text generation, translation, and summarization. With gpt-graph, users can provide a text document to the application, and it will extract the relevant entities and their relationships to create a graph.

gpt-graph uses cytoscape.js graph visualization library to display the graph in an interactive format. Users can explore the graph and its relationships by zooming in and out and moving around.
